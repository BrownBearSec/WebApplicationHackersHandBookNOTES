Core elements of defense mechanisms:
- Handling user access 
- Handling user input
- Handling attackers (how the app is dealt with when being directly attacked)
- Managing the application itself by enabling admins to monitor activites

# Handling User access

Authentication
- treating all users as anonymous is the lowest possible level of trust
- conventional authentication model = username + password
- security-critical applications (eg banks) = conventional auth model + (additional credentials | multistage login)
- even higher security = security-critical + (client certificates | smartcards | challenge-response tokens)
- Authentication requires supporting functionality, self-registratio, account recovery, password changing

Session Management
- To deal with countless amount of simultaneous authenticated requests sites use session tokens to keep track
- Ways of dealing with tokens: cookies, hidden form fields, url query string

Access control
- Probing for these vulnerabilities is often laboruous, effort is a worthwhile investment


# Approaches to input Handling

"Reject known bad"
- Blacklist-based filters can be bypassed in a stupid way
- -> if `SELECT` is blocked, try `SelEcT`
- -> If `or 1=1 -- -` is blocked try `or 2=2 -- -`
- -> if `alert("xss")` is blocked try `prompt("xss")`
- filters designed to block specific phrases/keywords can be bypassed as such
- -> `SELECT/*foo*/username,password/*foo*/FROM/*foo*/users`
- -> `<img%09onerror=alert(1) src=a>`
- many blacklist filters are vulnerable to NULL byte attacks because the filter sees them as terminators
- -> `%00<img src=x onerror=alert()>`

"Accept known good"
- Sometimes only matches at the start
- Sometimes regular inputs dont match what is "good" eg names contain `-` or `'`
- Can only be used well in specific circumstances, thus not used often

Sanitziation
- Potentially bad data is remove
- Potentially bad data is "escaped" by encoding

Multistep validation and canonicalization
- `<scr<script>ipt>` -> `<script>`
- Canonicalization is the process of converting or decoding data into a common character set. eg `ã€‹` is converted to `>` etc
- another example is double url decoding
